# Project Optimization Overview

This document provides an overview of the optimizations implemented in the project to increase performance.

## Project Setup

### Vite Integration

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) has been integrated into the project to use its fast build process.

### CSS and JavaScript Minification

Vite has been configured to automatically minify CSS and JavaScript files during the build process. This optimization reduces file sizes, resulting in faster loading times for users.

## Image Optimization

### Lazy Loading Images

Images in the project are lazily loaded, improving page load performance by deferring the loading of non-essential images until they are needed. However, the initial image above the fold is loaded immediately to prevent content shifting.

## JavaScript Optimization

### jQuery CDN Integration

To improve performance, jQuery has been replaced with a CDN-hosted version. This approach reduces the need for users to download jQuery from the server, leveraging faster network connections.

### Async and Defer Attributes

The `async` and `defer` attributes have been used for script tags to optimize script loading:

- **Async**: Scripts that are not required for initial page rendering but are essential for functionality have been marked as `async`. This allows them to be downloaded asynchronously while not blocking the HTML parsing and rendering process.

- **Defer**: Scripts that are required for initial page rendering but can be executed after HTML parsing have been marked as `defer`. This ensures that critical scripts are loaded and executed in the correct order without blocking rendering.

## Font Optimization

### Preloading Fonts

Fonts used in the project have been preloaded to prioritize their loading and ensure they are available when needed. This optimization improves font rendering and overall page performance.

## Considered Optimization Strategies

### Critical CSS Inclusion

While the concept of including critical CSS directly in the HTML to eliminate render-blocking CSS resources was considered, it was not implemented due to the complexity of identifying and extracting critical CSS from existing stylesheets. However, this approach remains a viable optimization strategy for future consideration.
